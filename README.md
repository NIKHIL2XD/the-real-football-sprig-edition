## About your game

**What is your game about?**

Its a football game based on old keypad phones football games. I tried to  give 90's vibe to gamers in this game, its similar to Sokoban, juggle the football and cross the hurdles to the goal. 
Update 1: Now you need to complete all level in a limited time, otherwise you will loose

<!-- Example: Pushing boxes to the goal. (from [Sokoban Plus](https://sprig.hackclub.com/gallery/sokoban_plus)) -->

**How do you play your game?**

Press W,S,A,D to move up down left right, J to restart, Push the ball through the hurdles to the goal 
<!-- Example: Press WASD to move, J to restart and K to toggle trails, Get A boxes (cyan) to A goals (green), Get B boxes (magenta) to B goals (red), Get normal boxes (gray) to either goal. (from [Sokoban plus](https://sprig.hackclub.com/gallery/sokoban_plus)) -->
